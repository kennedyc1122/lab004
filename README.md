Encapsulation and generalization helped our code become more reusable and also made the functions easier to read with how organized the code was. Having the functions and function 
calls in designated areas made viewing and writing the code easier instead of having all the function calls under the functions. I like it that way a lot more because there are many 
times it's hard to see what I'm calling and where it's at. What's also nice about generalization is that we can copy it and pass it an array of other numbers to create different 
sizes and/or place it in another part of the grid like the pumpkins. It made it so much easier so that we didn't have to just copy the body and I think learning those will help organize 
my code.
